    <h1>Why I Love Web Development</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>The ability to make things from an idea (webpages, apps, etc.) that can be used by real people when you're done</li>
      <li>The feeling of solving a problem or making an inconvenience more tolerable</li>
      <li>There is a multitude of correct ways to address something which allows for creativity</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I really enjoy learning about astrology and mythology. I especially like how stories and symbols from 100's of years ago are still (somewhat) applicable to the actions and feelings of people in today's age. Although there are likely many already in existence, I  think it would be cool to make a website that asks a user for their birth date, time, and location and provides information about what their signs mean. In addition to the meaning of their signs, I think it would be interesting to also provide the source mythology behind each astrological sign.</p>
